Explanation of differences:

1. Euclidean Distance vs Cosine Similarity:
   - Euclidean: Measures absolute difference in review counts.
   - Cosine: Measures the angle between review vectors, focusing on proportional similarities.

2. Between couples:
   - Top reviewers by total: Likely have higher NB values, potentially leading to larger Euclidean distances.
   - Top reviewers by distinct areas: Might have more evenly distributed reviews, possibly resulting in smaller Euclidean distances.

3. Compared to Jaccard/Overlap:
   - Euclidean and Cosine consider the number of reviews (NB), not just presence/absence.
   - This can reveal similarities in review patterns that binary measures miss.

4. Scale sensitivity:
   - Euclidean is sensitive to the scale of NB, while Cosine is not.
   - This might lead to larger differences in Euclidean distances between the two couples compared to Cosine similarities.

5. Interpretation:
   - Lower Euclidean distance indicates more similar review counts.
   - Higher Cosine similarity indicates more similar review patterns, regardless of absolute counts.

These metrics provide a more nuanced view of user similarity, considering both the areas reviewed and the intensity of reviews in each area.
