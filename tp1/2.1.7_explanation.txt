Explanation of differences when using ratings instead of NB:

1. Scale difference:
   - Ratings typically have a smaller range (e.g., 1-5) compared to NB (number of reviews).
   - This leads to smaller Euclidean distances overall when using ratings.

2. Interpretation:
   - Euclidean distance now represents the difference in how users rate areas, not how often they review.
   - Cosine similarity now shows how similarly users rate areas, regardless of the number of reviews.

3. Sensitivity:
   - Rating-based metrics are more sensitive to differences in user preferences and satisfaction.
   - NB-based metrics are more indicative of travel patterns and review frequency.

4. Between couples:
   - Top reviewers by total: Might have more consistent rating patterns due to more experience.
   - Top reviewers by distinct areas: Could show more varied ratings due to diverse experiences.

5. Compared to NB-based metrics:
   - Rating-based metrics might show different patterns of similarity.
   - Users with similar travel patterns (NB) might have different rating behaviors, or vice versa.

6. Potential biases:
   - Rating-based metrics might be influenced by individual rating styles (e.g., some users always give high ratings).
   - NB-based metrics are not affected by this but might be biased towards frequent travelers.

7. Completeness of information:
   - Rating-based metrics provide insight into user satisfaction and preferences.
   - NB-based metrics give information about travel patterns and review habits.

Using both NB and rating-based similarities provides a more comprehensive view of user similarity, capturing both behavior (frequency of reviews) and opinion (ratings given).
